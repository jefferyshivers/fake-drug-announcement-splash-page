# Fake Drug Announcement

This is a SPA made with React, Redux and CSS3. The prompt was to create a splash page for a (fake) drug announcement.

To run an instance of this, clone the repository, then `npm install` or `yarn install`. Then do `yarn build` to compile the project, then `yarn start` to serve it at `localhost:3000`.

You can view the project at https://precision-effect-screen.herokuapp.com.

## Notes

I used Flexbox with CSS3 (SASS and PostCSS) to design the UI, and the project is composed using ES6 modules with React. The styles are scoped to their respective components, and Webpack compiles everything with the latest Babel presets and loaders.
